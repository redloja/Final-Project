# Final-Project
ViT Final Project Proposal by Julie Mendez

Problems I am trying to solve with this project:
1. Lack of my knowledge with Javascript - I'd like to understand the basics of Javascript and get hands on to understand how the basic principles work
2. Figuring out how it "all" connects together - One thing I would like to work through is figuring out how different pieces of one project all work together. For example, linking html, css, and javascript
3. How to create a simple interactive animation - I have never created an animation with code so it will be a challenge figuring out how to make this work!

Goal:
1. Create an animation of a sun that changes shape and color when clicked.
